"""End-to-end integration tests for the sandbox egress allowlist.

Unlike ``test_sandbox_egress.py`` (which mocks Docker) and the shell
smoke at ``dockerfiles/test-sandbox-egress.sh`` (which bypasses
SandboxManager), this exercises the *production* code path:

    SandboxManager.get_sandbox_backend(tmp_dir)
        → _ensure_egress_proxy_running (real proxy + network)
        → containers.run (real sandbox on internal network)
    → DockerSandboxBackend.execute("curl ...")
        → container.exec_run (same call the agent's tool makes)

If anything in that chain regresses — proxy bring-up, network attach,
env-var injection, hash-based recreate — these tests catch it.

No skip: the egress contract is too important to silently no-op.
Docker is pre-installed on ``ubuntu-latest`` GitHub runners (the
CI environment) and is always available on the deploy host.  If
Docker is genuinely missing, setUpClass fails loudly with a real
error — that's better than a silent skip that masks the regression.
