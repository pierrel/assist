{{ task }}

Provide a concise plan. Rules:
- If this task is a pure rewrite / rephrase / classify / summarize / translate / extract-from-provided-text then output EXACTLY ONE STEP with NO tools (no search_*, no write_file_*).
- For simple fact lookup output EXACTLY ONE STEP using search_web only.
- Do NOT include write_file_user unless user explicitly asks to create/save/update a file or provides a file path.
- Each action starts with a verb or exact tool name if a tool is required.
- Keep actions unique.
Return only steps, assumptions, risks; do not answer the task directly.

Do NOT include write_file_user unless the user explicitly requested creating/updating/saving a file or gave a file path.
Avoid duplicate actions or objectives.
If this is a pure rewrite/rephrase/classify/extract/summarize task: produce ONE step and NO tools.
