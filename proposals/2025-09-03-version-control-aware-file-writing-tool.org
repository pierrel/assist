* Proposal: Version-Control-Aware File Writing Tool

** Overview
Design and implement a CLI tool (or library function) that writes content to a file only if the target directory is part of a version-controlled repository. Additionally, when writing to an existing file, the tool verifies that the file is already tracked by the repository. The tool aims to safeguard the codebase against untracked modifications, especially when invoked automatically by an LLM agent.

** Key Functional Requirements
1. *Repository Verification*
   - Before writing, confirm that the target directory is inside a Git repository (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`).
   - Abort with a descriptive error if no repository is found.

2. *File Tracking Check*
   - If the target file exists, run `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>` to confirm it is tracked.
   - Abort if the file exists but is not tracked, prompting the user to add it to version control first.

3. *Write Operation*
   - Accept path, content, and optional flags (e.g., overwrite/append).
   - Write content only after passing the checks above.
   - Optionally create parent directories if they are already part of the repository; otherwise, fail with an error.

4. *Commit Option (Optional)*
   - After writing, optionally stage (`git add`) and commit with a supplied message to ensure reproducibility of automated updates.
   - Skip committing if not requested, but leave a message reminding the user to commit manually.

5. *Logging & Dry Run*
   - Provide verbose logging for every action.
   - Offer a `--dry-run` mode to simulate the write without changing files.

6. *LLM-Friendly Interface*
   - Simple, explicit command-line flags (e.g., `--path`, `--content-file`, `--commit-message`).
   - Clear structured output (JSON or plain text) for easy parsing by automated systems.

** Risks and Safeguards

| Risk | Description | Safeguard(s) | Can it be fully mitigated? |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| *Accidental writes outside repository* | LLM mis-specifies the path or repository status changes between check and write | Verify repository status immediately before writing; fail if not inside a work tree | Yes, mitigated with pre-write checks |
| *Modifying untracked files* | Existing file is not under version control, leading to silent updates outside Git history | Use `git ls-files --error-unmatch` to ensure the file is tracked; abort otherwise | Yes, mitigated with tracking checks |
| *Race conditions* | Repository state changes between check and write (e.g., user deletes `.git` directory) | Perform checks immediately before write; lock file or repository if feasible | Partially—race conditions can never be entirely eliminated |
| *Overwriting important data* | LLM may write incorrect content or overwrite a file unintentionally | Provide `--dry-run` option; require explicit `--overwrite` flag; maintain version history via Git | No, but consequences can be minimized with commits |
| *Malicious prompt injection* | A poisoned prompt could instruct the LLM to bypass safeguards | Disallow bypass flags; run tool with minimal privileges; maintain human review | No, this risk remains although mitigations reduce likelihood |
| *Sensitive data leakage* | Writing or committing secrets inadvertently | Integrate secret scanning pre-commit; allow configurable deny lists | Partially—scanners reduce but cannot guarantee absence of secrets |

** Conclusion
This tool enforces that all writes happen within version-controlled directories and, for existing files, only when those files are tracked. By combining repository checks, file-tracking enforcement, optional auto-commit, and comprehensive logging, it provides a safeguard against unintended modifications, especially in automated LLM-driven workflows. The risk analysis identifies potential failure points and mitigation strategies, highlighting areas (e.g., race conditions, prompt injection) where risk can be reduced but not eliminated entirely.
