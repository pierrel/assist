* Context
There's a need to include many more examples to stress test the system and make changes to improve the capabilities.

* Solution
Add many tests that simulate real user situations, tasks, and queries. The tests should cover a wide variety of queries:
- Rephrase a sentence or re-write some code.
-

The tests should cover situations that need to be handled well by the system:
- Queries that don't need any tools
- Proper tools are used when appropriate
- Replans are required
- Execution steps are handled well
- Summaries are appropriate
- No internal (to the model) knowledge is used
- Executing WRITE operations
- Write/test/re-write coding loops

The tests should be aspirational, they do not all need to work right away.

* Requirements
These should be implemented in the =tests/validation= module.

** V1 - Planner
Implement the example scenarios for the =test_planner_node.py= suite of tests. The same pattern found currently in the file should be continued as much as possible.

The assertions should validate reasonable expectations of the plan steps. Some examples (will change depending on the scenario):
- Multiple steps are created
- No tools are used for simple English-language rewrites (unless very uncommon words are used,  in which case a search for the correct usage should be executed)
- Tools are used whenever external knowledge would even help
** V2 - Executor
TBD
** V3 - Replanner
TBD
** V4 - Summary
TBD
* Example scenarios
Awesome—here are 10, moving from simple → agentic. For each, I give two tiny example inputs you could swap in for the referenced “this …”:

1. **Rewrite this to be more professional.**

   * Example A: “hey—need that report asap. thx.”
   * Example B: “We kinda dropped the ball on the Q3 metrics.”

2. **Rephrase for a 9th-grade reading level.**

   * Example A: “The municipality’s fiscal posture necessitates austerity measures.”
   * Example B: “Our platform leverages distributed systems to optimize throughput.”

3. **Extract all dates, people, and organizations from this text into JSON.**

   * Example A: “On March 2, 2024, Mayor London Breed met with leaders from SFUSD.”
   * Example B: “Apple hired Sam Patel on 2023-11-14 after interviews at UCSF.”

4. **Classify these customer messages into issue categories; return CSV.**

   * Example A (mini set):

     1. “App crashes when I upload a photo.”
     2. “How do I reset my password?”
     3. “Please cancel my subscription.”
     4. “Charged twice for August.”
   * Example B (mini set):

     1. “Search results are super slow.”
     2. “Two-factor code never arrives.”
     3. “Dark mode text is unreadable.”

5. **Refactor this function for readability and add docstrings and type hints.**

   * Example A (Python):

     ```python
     def f(a,b):
         r=[]
         for i in a:
             if i not in r: r.append(i)
         for j in b:
             if j not in r: r.append(j)
         return r
     ```
   * Example B (Python):

     ```python
     def calc(x):
         t=0
         for i in range(len(x)):
             t=t+x[i]
         return t/len(x)
     ```

6. **Implement a small Python CLI with argparse that performs tasks X and Y.**

   * Example A: X = “convert a .txt file to uppercase”, Y = “count words and print top-5 by frequency”.
   * Example B: X = “merge two CSVs by ‘id’”, Y = “filter rows where ‘amount’ > 100 and save”.

7. **Research the best minimalist mechanical watches under \$3k; compare and cite.**

   * Example A: “Field watches under \$1.5k, 38–40 mm, sapphire, no date.”
   * Example B: “Dress watches under \$2.5k, <10 mm thick, Bauhaus aesthetics.”

8. **Create a day-trip plan using rideshare only; estimate times/costs; output a tweakable sheet.**

   * Example A: “Sonoma plaza stroll + one tasting + lunch, 4 adults, Saturday 9/20.”
   * Example B: “Half Moon Bay coastal walk + café lunch, 2 adults, Sunday 10/5.”

9. **File an expense report from provided PDFs: extract line items, code them, total, attach, submit.**

   * Example A: Receipts = “Lyft \$28.34 (08/12), Coffee \$6.50 (08/12), Lunch w/ client \$54.20 (08/12).”
   * Example B: Receipts = “SFO⇄LAX airfare \$216.90 (08/25), Hotel 1 night \$189.00 (08/25), Per-diem dinner \$35.00.”

10. **Run a benchmark comparing three LLMs on a supplied prompt suite; chart quality/latency; memo.**
- Example A (coding suite):

  * “Write a JSON Schema for a contact record.”
  * “Explain time complexity of this function and optimize.”
  * “Fix this failing pytest with minimal changes.”
- Example B (reasoning/summarization suite):

  * “Summarize article into 5 bullets ≤80 chars.”
  * “Extract dates/people/orgs into JSON.”
  * “Classify support tickets into {Billing, Access, Bug}.”
