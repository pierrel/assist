* Problem
Project index and system info index dbs are stored in a temporary directly and regularly cleaned up. This causes frequent re-indexing.
* Solution
Provide a way to set the database directories with a command-line input.
* Requirements
1. Accept a command-line argument, "--index-db" that is a file path.
2. The file path should be used by both project index and system info tools to store the database
3. If the user cannot access the path, then raise an error on server start
4. If the directory does not exist, then create it
5. Each of project and system info indexes create their own sub-directory that they can use to store their files and dbs
6. For convenience, create a "scripts/startup" shell script that launches the server with a given index db directory. It should also set the virtual environment correctly.
* Implementation details
To be filled in later.
