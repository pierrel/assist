* Problem
Project index and system info index dbs are stored in a temporary directly and regularly cleaned up. This causes frequent re-indexing.
* Solution
Provide a way to set the database directories with a command-line input.
* Requirements
1. Accept a command-line argument, "--index-db" that is a file path.
2. The file path should be used by both project index and system info tools to store the database
3. If the user cannot access the path, then raise an error on server start
4. If the directory does not exist, then create it
5. Each of project and system info indexes create their own sub-directory that they can use to store their files and dbs
6. For convenience, create a "scripts/startup" shell script that launches the server with a given index db directory. It should also set the virtual environment correctly.
* Implementation details
1. **CLI parsing**
   - Extend ``assist/server.py`` to use ``argparse`` in ``__main__`` and
     accept ``--index-db``.
   - Resolve the argument to an absolute ``Path``.
   - If the directory does not exist, create it with
     ``path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)``.
   - If creation fails or the directory is not readable and writable,
     raise ``SystemExit`` so the server refuses to start.
   - Store the resolved path in a module level variable
     ``INDEX_DB_ROOT`` for later use.

2. **Project index location**
   - Update ``assist/tools/project_index.py``:
     - ``ProjectIndex`` gains an optional ``base_dir`` parameter.
       When provided it is used instead of ``tempfile.gettempdir``.
     - ``index_dir`` now returns ``base_dir / 'projects' /
       <hash_of_project_root>`` and ensures the directory exists.

3. **System info location**
   - Update ``assist/tools/system_info.py`` so
     ``SystemInfoIndex`` accepts ``base_dir``.
   - Construct its internal ``ProjectIndex`` with
     ``base_dir / 'system'`` so system and project data are separated.
   - ``_prepare_dir`` uses this base path and creates the directory if
     necessary.

4. **Server wiring**
   - ``get_agent`` creates ``ProjectIndex`` and ``SystemInfoIndex``
     using ``INDEX_DB_ROOT`` established during CLI parsing.

5. **Startup script**
   - Add ``scripts/startup``:
     - Activates the repository's virtual environment
       (``.venv/bin/activate``).
     - Invokes ``python -m assist.server --index-db "$1"`` where the
       first argument is the desired database directory.
     - Example usage: ``scripts/startup ~/.cache/assist``.

These changes allow both project and system info indexes to persist in a
user‑specified location while retaining separate sub‑directories.
