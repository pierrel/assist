The point of the basic_custom_server is to create a simple langserve instance
that can interact with gptel. These are the tasks I need to complete
to realize this:
1. [X] Get it running locally
2. [X] Send a request
3. [X] Point gptel to local version
4. [X] Ensure it works as expected
5. [X] Update to point to locally running instance (try with Ollama interface)


Configuration for Gptel:
#+begin_src elisp
(gptel-make-openai "Local"
  :protocol "http"
  :host "localhost:5000"
  :endpoint "/chat/completions"
  :key "made up"
  :stream nil)
#+end_src
